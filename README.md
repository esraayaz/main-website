ðŸŒ± I coded this website using Next.js and GSAP for the first time. It was a very useful experience for me.

Innovations I plan to develop:
ðŸ“Œ Add a blog section
ðŸ“Œ Add a dark/light mode

âœ… The email sending feature with Web3form + React-toastify is working smoothly.

âœ… Fully responsive design.
